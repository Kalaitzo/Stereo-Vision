# Stereo-Vision
Semester project for my 3D Computer Geometry &amp; Vision course.

The provided application is a simple stereo vision application that uses two webcams to create a 3D reconstruction of 
the scene in front of the cameras. 

<strong>
Important:
</strong>
The functionality that triangulates a point cloud isn't available due to the fact that the 
pointcloud used was to lage to upload on GitHub. So if the user tries to run that function 
by pressing the button <strong>G</strong> the program will crash.
